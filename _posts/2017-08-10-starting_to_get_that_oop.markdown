At first, the thought of learning Object Oriented Programming was daunting to me. I don't know why exactly, I just know that when I saw those words I was petrified. So far my journey through the “Intro to Ruby Development” course at Flatiron School has been very challenging (more than I thought it would be), but **I just completed it yesterday and I am feeling pretty darn proud of myself right now**.

I've mostly worked with front-end coding languages, and so far most of my back-end experience has been tweaking PHP in Wordpress, and a little ASP.NET in other CMSs. So learning Ruby is a huge step forward for me in my back-end coding language education.

I like Flatiron School's approach of starting you off with learning Ruby; their philosophy being that once you learn Ruby it will be much easier to learn other coding languages, especially front-end ones like JavaScript.

The Intro course starts you off with the fundamentals of Procedural Ruby which I’ve found very challenging to grasp thus far. After that, they introduce you to the fundamentals of Object Oriented Ruby.

And I don't know what it is, but after I got over my initial fear of OOP and jumped right in, it all sort of clicked for me.

There was just something about the concept of an object class containing both the data and the instructions that I really liked. Learning about instance classes and instance variables and how they all connect. Setter vs. getter methods and how a setter writes and the getter reads. Ooh, and the initialize method.

I realize I am in the beginning stages of learning OOP and have a long way to go, but insofar as an introduction goes, I am really excited about learning more. And right now, I feel like the concepts of Object Oriented Ruby are clicking with me more than Procedural Ruby for some reason. Perhaps it’s the application?

Currently, I am reviewing the introduction part of the “Procedural Ruby” course since this is the next one I must complete, then I get to jump back into Object Oriented Ruby; I am really looking forward to learning more about the `attr_accessor` and class variables.
